# Walmart Risk Detection App - Feature Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Task Completed Successfully

### ✅ Expanded Dataset
- **50 Walmart Centers** across different US locations
- **100 Shops** with varying risk levels (high, medium, low)
- All data stored in both SQLite (`walmart_risk.db`) and can be setup for Neon PostgreSQL

### ✅ Files Created/Updated
- `shops_centers.txt` - Complete listing of all centers and shops
- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application with new features
- `db.py` - Database functions including `get_all_centers()`
- `setup_database.py` - SQLite setup with expanded data
- `setup_neon.py` - Neon PostgreSQL setup
- `postgresql_setup.sql` - SQL script for PostgreSQL
- `test_features.py` - Feature testing script
- `test_sqlite.py` - Database verification script

### ✅ Interactive Features Implemented

#### 🗺️ Path Visualization
- **Purple lines** drawn from selected shop to ALL Walmart centers
- Lines appear when you click any shop marker on the map
- Visual paths show feasible connections between locations

#### 📏 Distance Calculations
- **Haversine formula** for accurate geographical distance
- Distances shown in **both km and meters**:
  - For distances ≥ 1km: `"X.XX km (YYYY m)"`
  - For distances < 1km: `"XXX m (0.XXX km)"`
- **Top 5 closest centers** displayed with distances

#### 🎯 Interactive Shop Selection
- Click any shop marker to:
  - Highlight the shop with detailed info
  - Show paths to all 50 Walmart centers
  - Display distance calculations
  - View risk analysis report
- **Clear Paths** button to reset the view

### ✅ Map Features
- **50 Walmart centers** shown as blue/light blue markers
- **100 shops** with color-coded risk levels:
  - 🔴 Red: High Risk
  - 🟡 Yellow: Medium Risk
  - 🟢 Green: Low Risk
- **Real-time statistics** showing shop counts and risk distribution
- **Coverage circles** around Walmart centers (2km radius)
- **Interactive legend** and controls

### ✅ Technical Implementation

#### Distance Unit Display
```python
if distance >= 1.0:
    st.markdown(f"{center_name}: {distance:.2f} km ({distance_meters:.0f} m)")
else:
    st.markdown(f"{center_name}: {distance_meters:.0f} m ({distance:.3f} km)")
```

#### Path Visualization
```python
# Draw lines to all centers when shop is selected
for center_id, center_name, center_lat, center_lon in all_centers:
    folium.PolyLine(
        locations=[[shop_lat, shop_lon], [center_lat, center_lon]],
        color='purple',
        weight=3,
        opacity=0.8,
        popup=f"Path from {shop_name} to {center_name}"
    ).add_to(m)
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd "c:\Users\prash\OneDrive\Desktop\Prash08484\Entire-Project"
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2. Open in Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:8502`

### 3. Test Interactive Features
1. **Click any shop marker** (red, yellow, or green circles)
2. **Observe purple lines** appearing from shop to all centers
3. **Check distance display** in both km and meters below the map
4. **Use "Clear Paths" button** to reset the view
5. **Try different shops** to see varying distances

### 4. Verify Data
- **50 centers** should be visible as blue markers
- **100 shops** should be visible with color-coded risk levels
- **Statistics panel** shows counts and risk distribution
